## Hi there 👋
I'm Bhupesh!

I'm a student exploring the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**. I'm passionate about building cool things with code and constantly learning new technologies.
A focused and meticulous AI/ML enthusiast with a keen dedication to bringing projects to fruition. My strategy is to be intentional about what I take on, so that when I do commit, I bring a solution to completion with all my focus and enthusiasm.

My passion for problem-solving is also rooted in interactive, narrative-driven games like Elden Ring. The worlds have taught me the importance of forward planning, careful preparation, and sheer grit needed to conquer daunting obstacles—a mindset that I transfer directly when solving a difficult algorithm or debugging an intractable bug. Beating a difficult boss and discovering that elegant solution in code give me the same thrill of victory.

When I require clearing the headspace and adopting a new point of view, I resort to venturing into nature's panoramas. The serenity and purity from a stunning vista are priceless and serve to enable me to revert back to complex issues with fresh motivation. This, coupled with enjoying reading, arouses my curiosity and continues to educate me.

Experience & Skills:

Core CS: Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C++.

AI/ML: Building practical projects with Python, leveraging libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

Goal: Seeking to apply my focused, determined approach to solve real-world problems as part of a challenging internship.
